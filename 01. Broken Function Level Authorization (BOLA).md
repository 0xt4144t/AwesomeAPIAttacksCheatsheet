Broken Function Level Authorization occurs when an application fails to properly enforce user permissions for specific API actions or functions. Even though users may be authenticated, they are able to access or invoke API endpoints or methods that should be restricted based on their role or privilege level.

Security Test Cases:

1.1 Test whether API endpoints properly enforce object-level authorization by attempting to access resources owned by other users.

Steps:

Authenticate as a standard user (e.g., userA).
Access a known endpoint that retrieves user-specific resources, such as:

GET /api/v1/users/1234/profile

3. Modify the 1234 ID in the URL to another valid numeric or alphanumeric ID (e.g., 5678 or ABCD), which may belong to a different user (userB).

4. Observe whether the API returns the target userâ€™s data or errors out.
