## 1. Broken Function Level Authorization (BOLA)

**Definition:**
Broken Function Level Authorization occurs when an application fails to properly enforce user permissions for specific API actions or functions. Even if users are authenticated, they can access or invoke API endpoints that should be restricted based on their role or privilege level.

### üîê 1.1 Object-Level Authorization Bypass

**Test:** Verify whether API endpoints properly enforce object-level authorization by attempting to access resources owned by other users.

**Steps:**

1. Authenticate as a standard user (e.g., `userA`).
2. Access a known endpoint that retrieves user-specific resources:

   ```
   GET /api/v1/users/1234/profile
   ```
3. Modify the `1234` ID in the URL to another valid numeric or alphanumeric ID (e.g., `5678` or `ABCD`) which may belong to a different user (`userB`).
4. Observe whether the API returns the target user‚Äôs data or properly denies access.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The API should validate whether the authenticated user has access to the requested object.
* If the resource does not belong to the user or their role, it should return a `403 Forbidden` or `404 Not Found`.
