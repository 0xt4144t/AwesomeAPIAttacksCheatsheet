## 2. Broken Authentication

**Definition:**
Broken Authentication occurs when APIs improperly implement authentication mechanisms, allowing attackers to compromise credentials, impersonate users, or bypass login protections. This includes flaws in password handling, session token management, brute-force protection, and missing authentication altogether.

---

### 2.1 Weak Password Policy

**Test:** Create easy and guessable passwords
**Scenario:** Attempt to register or change a password using weak inputs like `123456`, `password1`, or `qwerty`.
**Expected Behavior:** API should enforce strong password requirements (length, complexity, blacklist).

---

### 2.2 Brute Force Login

**Test:** Brute Force Against User Accounts
**Scenario:** Use a tool or script to attempt multiple logins with common passwords against a known username.
**Expected Behavior:** API should enforce rate limiting, lockouts, or CAPTCHA.

---

### 2.3 Missing Confirmation on Sensitive Actions

**Test:** Users can change their password without asking for password confirmation
**Scenario:** Submit a password change request without providing the current password.
**Expected Behavior:** API must require current password as confirmation to prevent session hijack abuse.

**Test:** Users can change their email without asking for password confirmation
**Scenario:** Submit a request to update the account email without verifying identity or password.
**Expected Behavior:** Require re-authentication or password entry for email change.

---

### 2.4 Token Disclosure

**Test:** Token or password is exposed in the URL
**Scenario:** Observe if sensitive tokens appear in query strings or redirects, e.g., `/reset?token=XYZ`
**Expected Behavior:** Tokens must be passed in headers or POST body, not URLs.

---

### 2.5 GraphQL Authentication Abuse

**Test:** GraphQL queries allow many login attempts in a single request
**Scenario:** Use batched GraphQL queries to send multiple auth attempts in one request.
**Expected Behavior:** API should count each attempt individually and rate-limit accordingly.

---

### 2.6 Missing Authentication

**Test:** Sensitive endpoints are accessible without authentication
**Scenario:** Try accessing endpoints like `/profile`, `/transactions`, or `/admin` without tokens or headers.
**Expected Behavior:** API should return `401 Unauthorized`.

---

### 2.7 Credential Stuffing

**Test:** Brute-force users with many username/password combos
**Scenario:** Use credential dumps to automate login attempts across known user emails.
**Expected Behavior:** Rate-limiting, IP blocking, and alerting should be in place.

---

### 2.8 Guessable or Predictable Tokens

**Test:** Use incremental or guessable tokens for session/auth
**Scenario:** Modify token IDs to access different accounts (e.g., `token_1001` → `token_1002`).
**Expected Behavior:** Tokens should be cryptographically secure and unguessable.

---

### 2.9 JWT Security Flaws

**Test:** API accepts unsigned JWTs (`alg=none`)
**Scenario:** Submit a tampered JWT with `alg: none` and observe if it’s accepted.
**Expected Behavior:** API must reject unsigned tokens or enforce signing algorithm.

**Test:** JWT expiration (`exp`) not enforced
**Scenario:** Use a valid JWT past its expiration time and check if it’s still accepted.
**Expected Behavior:** API must strictly enforce token expiry.

**Test:** Sensitive data disclosed in JWT payload
**Scenario:** Decode JWT and inspect payload for PII or credentials (e.g., email, roles, password hashes).
**Expected Behavior:** JWTs should not include sensitive information unless encrypted.

**Test:** JWT signed with a weak key
**Scenario:** Use a brute-force tool to guess the signing key if HMAC is used (e.g., short secret like `admin`).
**Expected Behavior:** Signing key should be long, random, and stored securely.
