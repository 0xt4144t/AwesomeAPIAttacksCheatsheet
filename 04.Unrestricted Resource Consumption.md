## 4. Unrestricted Resource Consumption

**No Rate Limit for Specific Resource**

---

### 4.1 The API Does Not Enforce Execution Timeouts

**Scenario:**
Send a computationally expensive request (e.g., a large database query or a regex-based filter) and measure the response time.

**Expected Behavior:**

* API should terminate long-running operations after a defined threshold (e.g., 5–10 seconds).
* The client should receive a `504 Gateway Timeout` or a custom error response.

---

### 4.2 Maximum Allowable Memory

**Test:** The API allocates excessive memory for request processing.

**Scenario:**
Submit a very large or deeply nested JSON/XML payload to observe whether the API crashes, becomes unresponsive, or is vulnerable to DoS attacks.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The backend should enforce strict memory limits per request.
* Large payloads should be rejected with a `413 Payload Too Large` or `400 Bad Request`.

---

### 4.3 Maximum Number of File Descriptors

**Test:** The API does not limit open file descriptors per process.

**Scenario:**
Upload multiple files or make concurrent requests that open file streams (e.g., PDF generation, CSV exports).

**Expected Behavior:**

* The API should limit concurrent file access and apply OS-level descriptor caps.
* If limits are exceeded, the system should fail gracefully without impacting other users.

---

### 4.4 Maximum Number of Processes

**Test:** The API allows uncontrolled spawning of backend processes.

**Scenario:**
Send requests that spawn subprocesses (e.g., shell commands, converters, async tasks) and monitor system performance under load.

**Expected Behavior:**

* APIs should restrict concurrent processes and queue excess tasks.
* Apply resource quotas or container-based sandboxing to control resource use.

---

### 4.5 Maximum Upload File Size

**Test:** The API accepts arbitrarily large files.

**Scenario:**
Upload a file significantly larger than expected (e.g., 500MB+).

**Expected Behavior:**

* API should reject files exceeding predefined limits (e.g., 10MB–100MB).
* Return a `413 Payload Too Large` error with a clear explanation.

---

### 4.6 GraphQL Operation Batching

**Test:** The API allows unlimited operations in a single GraphQL batch request.

**Scenario:**
Send a GraphQL batch request containing 50–100 login or data-fetch queries.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Enforce a hard cap on operations per request (e.g., 10).
* Reject excess with a `400 Bad Request` and descriptive error.

---

### 4.7 Pagination Abuse

**Test:** The API returns excessive records per request.

**Scenario:**
Request data using large pagination parameters (e.g., `?limit=10000`).

**Expected Behavior:**

* Cap the maximum number of records per page (e.g., 100–500).
* Return paginated results and override excessive client-supplied values.

---

### 4.8 API Spending Limit

**Test:** No enforced spending or quota limits with third-party services.

**Scenario:**
Abuse integrations like SMS, email, OCR, or payment APIs to incur excessive usage and costs.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Enforce spending quotas via rate limiting or budget controls.
* Trigger alerts or hard caps when anomalies are detected.
