## 5. Broken Function Level Authorization

---

### 5.1 Privilege Escalation

**Test:** Try to access administrative endpoints intended for elevated roles.

**Scenario:**
While authenticated as a regular user, attempt to access administrator-only endpoints. For example:

* Access `GET /admin/account/12345` instead of the standard user endpoint `GET /users/12345/account/balance`.
* Modify the URL manually or via a proxy tool like Burp Suite to call admin-only routes.

This simulates horizontal privilege escalation by targeting endpoints used internally by admins, potentially bypassing role-based access checks if improperly configured.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The API should verify the caller’s role or privileges before allowing access to admin-specific routes.
* Requests from non-admin users should return a `403 Forbidden` or `401 Unauthorized`.
* Backend logic should enforce access control independently of the UI or client.

### 5.2 HTTP Verb Tampering

**Test:** Attempt to edit or delete data by manipulating the HTTP method from `GET` to `POST`, `DELETE`, or `PATCH`.

**Scenario:**
Identify a read-only endpoint such as `GET /api/v1/users/123/profile`, which returns user data. Modify the request in a tool like Burp Suite or Postman to use a different HTTP method:

* `DELETE /api/v1/users/123/profile` — attempts to remove the user
* `PATCH /api/v1/users/123/profile` — attempts to modify the user
* `POST /api/v1/users/123/profile` — attempts to create/update data improperly

Observe whether the server permits unintended operations due to missing method validation or overly generic route handling.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The API must explicitly allow only defined methods for each endpoint.
* Improper HTTP methods should return a `405 Method Not Allowed` or `403 Forbidden`.
* Sensitive operations must be restricted by both HTTP verb and user privileges.
