## 6. Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows

**Definition:**
Unrestricted Access to Sensitive Business Flows represents the risk of an attacker being able to identify and exploit API-driven workflows. If vulnerable, an attacker can manipulate an organization’s API request structure to obstruct or degrade other users' experience. This could include:

* Spamming other users
* Depleting inventory or limited resources
* Locking out expected app functionality through repeated abuse

### 6.1 No Rate Limit for Specific Operation

**Test:** Perform repeated requests to a sensitive endpoint and observe if rate limiting is enforced.

**Scenario:**
Select an operation that should be throttled due to its impact or sensitivity, such as:

* `POST /api/v1/auth/login` — brute-force password attempts
* `POST /api/v1/2fa/verify` — OTP verification flooding
* `POST /api/v1/password/reset` — password reset abuse
* `GET /api/v1/search` — data scraping or enumeration

Send a high volume of requests in a short time window (e.g., 50–100 within a few seconds) using a script or tool like Burp Intruder, Postman Runner, or a custom Python loop.

**Expected Behavior:**

* The API should detect and block excessive requests, returning `429 Too Many Requests`.
* Rate limits should be enforced per IP address, user account, or token.
* Response headers should indicate rate limit status (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Remaining`).
