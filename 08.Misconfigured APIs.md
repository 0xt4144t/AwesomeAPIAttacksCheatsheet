## 8. Misconfigurations and Hardening Issues

---

### 8.1 Misconfigured Headers

**Test:** Identify response headers that leak information or indicate weak security posture.

**Scenario:**
Send requests to various API endpoints and inspect the HTTP response headers. Look specifically for:

* `X-Powered-By`: Reveals backend technologies such as Express, PHP, ASP.NET, which can aid attackers in targeting known exploits.
* `X-XSS-Protection`: A value of `0` disables basic browser XSS protection. A value of `1` enables it, though modern standards prefer Content Security Policy (CSP).
* `X-Response-Time`: Can be used as a side-channel to infer the existence of resources based on how long the server takes to respond to valid vs. invalid requests.

**Expected Behavior:**

* `X-Powered-By` should be removed or replaced with a generic value.
* `X-XSS-Protection` should be set to `1; mode=block` if used, or replaced with a robust CSP header.
* `X-Response-Time` should be removed to prevent timing-based inference or enumeration.

### 8.2 Misconfigured API (Insecure Transport Layer)

**Test:** Identify lack of HTTPS or weak SSL/TLS configurations.

**Scenario:**

* Attempt to access API endpoints over HTTP instead of HTTPS (e.g., `http://api.example.com`).
* Use tools like SSL Labs, `testssl.sh`, or `nmap --script ssl-enum-ciphers` to check for weak cipher suites, expired certificates, or support for insecure protocols (e.g., TLS 1.0/1.1).

**Expected Behavior:**

* API must enforce HTTPS by redirecting or rejecting HTTP requests.
* SSL/TLS must use strong, modern configurations (e.g., TLS 1.2 or 1.3).
* Certificates must be valid, CA-signed, and not self-signed in production.

### 8.3 Use of Default or Hardcoded Accounts

**Test:** Attempt to authenticate using known default credentials.

**Scenario:**

* Try logging in with default usernames/passwords like `admin:admin`, `root:toor`, or `test:test`.
* Analyze static config files or logs for hardcoded tokens or secrets.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Default accounts should be disabled or removed in production.
* All credentials must be configurable, securely stored, and regularly rotated.
* Enforce strong password policies and implement MFA.

---

### 8.4 Acceptance of Unnecessary HTTP Methods

**Test:** Identify unused or dangerous HTTP methods accepted by the API.

**Scenario:**
Use tools like `curl -X OPTIONS` or `nmap --script http-methods` to probe for unsafe methods such as `PUT`, `DELETE`, `TRACE`, or `CONNECT`.

**Expected Behavior:**

* API should only allow necessary HTTP methods per endpoint.
* Unsupported methods should return `405 Method Not Allowed`.
* `OPTIONS` responses should reflect only supported methods for CORS.

---

### 8.5 Lack of Input Sanitization

**Test:** Inject malformed or dangerous input to assess sanitization.

**Scenario:**

* Submit payloads like `'; DROP TABLE users --`, `<script>alert(1)</script>`, or long strings to endpoints such as `POST /comments` or `PUT /profile`.
* Check if the API reflects or stores unfiltered data, or exposes system-level errors.

**Expected Behavior:**

* All user input must be validated and sanitized server-side.
* Use parameterized queries and strict field validation.
* Input should be checked for type, length, and character constraints.

### 8.6 Verbose Error Messages

**Test:** Trigger controlled errors and inspect returned messages.

**Scenario:**
Send malformed requests (e.g., missing fields, invalid parameters) to force errors. Look for:

* Stack traces
* Internal file paths
* SQL errors
* Framework or version disclosures

**Expected Behavior:**

* API should return clean, generic error messages (e.g., `400 Bad Request`, `500 Internal Server Error`).
* Technical details must be logged internally, not exposed to users.
* Use a unified error-handling framework to sanitize and manage error output.
