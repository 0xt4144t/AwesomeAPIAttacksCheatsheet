## 9. Improper Inventory Management

---

### 9.1 Fuzzing for Versioned Endpoints

**Test:** Discover versioned endpoints such as `/v1`, `/v2`, `/v3` through forced browsing or fuzzing.

**Scenario:**
Probe the API base path with common version suffixes (e.g., `/api/v1/users`, `/api/v2/auth`) to detect older or undocumented versions still exposed.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Deprecated versions should return `404 Not Found` or `403 Forbidden`.
* Only officially supported versions should be discoverable.
* Implement API versioning with a defined lifecycle and strict access control.

---

### 9.2 Exposure of Development Paths

**Test:** Attempt access to paths like `/alpha`, `/beta`, `/demo`, `/sandbox`.

**Scenario:**
Use tools or manual fuzzing to check for:

* `/api/alpha/products`
* `/demo/login`
* `/sandbox/testdata`

These paths may lead to less-secure development builds or mock data endpoints.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Development routes must be removed or secured in production.
* All non-production paths should require authentication or IP restriction.
* Avoid deploying internal preview routes on public domains.

---

### 9.3 Unauthorized Development Environments (UAT/Testing/Staging)

**Test:** Access common internal paths like `/uat`, `/testing`, or `/staging`.

**Scenario:**
Attempt to reach URLs such as:

* `https://api.example.com/uat/health`
* `https://app.example.com/staging/login`
* `https://api.example.com/testing/config`

These may expose unreviewed or vulnerable builds with incomplete security controls.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Access to all non-production environments should require strong authentication.
* APIs in these paths should not be reachable via public DNS.
* Use `robots.txt` and DNS-level protections to prevent indexing.

---

### 9.4 Non-Production Domains Disclosure

**Test:** Probe common subdomains like `uat.app.com`, `staging.app.com`, `dev.api.com`.

**Scenario:**
Use DNS enumeration tools (e.g., `amass`, `subfinder`) or browser tools to discover subdomains pointing to UAT, QA, or staging environments.

**Expected Behavior:**

* Non-production domains should have:

  * Authentication enabled
  * Rate limits in place
  * Clear separation from production data
* Consider isolating these environments behind VPNs or whitelisted IP ranges.
