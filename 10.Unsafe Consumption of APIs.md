10. Unsafe Consumption of APIs
Third-Party API Integration Assessment

Test: Assess APIs used with third-party vendors from all security aspects.

Scenario:

Identify and analyze any API interactions that occur with external service providers (e.g., payment gateways, analytics APIs, SMS/email APIs, identity providers). Assess the following:

    Authentication & Authorization: How are tokens/keys handled? Are they securely stored and scoped?
    Data Exposure: What data is being sent to or returned by the third-party? Is it excessive or sensitive?
    Transport Security: Is communication with third-party APIs encrypted with strong TLS?
    Error Handling: Do third-party failures expose internal state or leak stack traces?
    Rate Limiting & Abuse: Is the third-party API protected against excessive usage or denial of wallet attacks?
    Spending Control: Is there a cap on billing or resource consumption from third-party services?

Expected Behavior:

    Third-party interactions should be authenticated using scoped, revocable API keys or OAuth tokens.
    Only necessary data should be shared â€” no sensitive or PII should be sent unless encrypted and authorized.
    Communication must occur over HTTPS with valid certificates.
    Response handling should gracefully manage third-party outages without exposing internal logic.
    Spending and quota limits must be enforced via usage monitoring or third-party platform controls.
    APIs should log and monitor third-party calls for auditing and anomaly detection.
