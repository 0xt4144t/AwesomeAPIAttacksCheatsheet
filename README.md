# AwesomeAPIAttacksCheatsheet
I was searching for such resource to work as cheat sheet series and guide me through different attack scenarios for API attacks, didn’t find one, so decided to create it. We will have a reference of OWASP Top 10 project besides some other attacks that weren’t mentioned in the top 10 project.
